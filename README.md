# Explainable-Fake-News-Detector
Our aim for this project is to:
* Integrate Explainable AI with a PreTrained Language Model trained on fake news. We implement this to analyse the incorrect samples being generated and provide insights to their occurence. 
* Also provide suggestions on how we can improve the model's performance and prevent the false positives.

Dataset Used: [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

Hugging Face Model: https://huggingface.co/SupritiVijay/fake-news-detector

## Results:

Our model achieves a very high accuracy on the dataset. Thus, we examine the slightly incorrect or unsure samples for inference.
